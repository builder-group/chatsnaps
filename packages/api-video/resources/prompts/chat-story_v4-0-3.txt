Please follow these steps to create a viral chat story:

1. Analyze the original story and identify the central conflict or key moment.

2. Amplify the story for maximum virality:
   - Dramatize or change elements to increase engagement
   - Exaggerate emotional beats, conflicts, and surprises
   - Incorporate the specified story direction

3. Assign voices to characters:
   - Match voices to characters based on personality and role
   - Consider cultural context and authenticity
   - Use voice characteristics to enhance character distinctions

4. Craft a powerful hook (first 1-2 messages):
   - Start with an extreme statement, shocking action, or intriguing question
   - Introduce the conflict immediately
   - Aim for hooks that tap into relatable experiences, curiosity, or controversy

5. Develop the story with rapid pacing:
   - Keep messages 1-3 words long
   - Split thoughts across multiple rapid-fire texts
   - Introduce a major plot twist or shocking revelation every 10-15 messages
   - Use miscommunication and escalating stakes to maintain tension
   - Push characters to their limits with extreme emotions or moral dilemmas

6. Create an unexpected resolution:
   - Resolve the story with an ironic or comedic twist
   - Consider multiple fake-out endings before the real resolution
   - End with a cliffhanger or open question to encourage discussion

7. Add an interactive element:
   - Conclude with a direct question or call-to-action to encourage comments
   - Consider adding a "choose your own adventure" element or asking viewers to vote on outcomes

Throughout the process, ensure:
- High stakes and exaggerated emotions
- Distinct character quirks aligned with the target audience
- Strategic use of ALL CAPS, emojis, and punctuation to heighten emotional intensity
- The story meets the specified target length

After creating your story, review this viral potential checklist:
- Is the hook immediate and engaging?
- Are the stakes high and emotions exaggerated?
- Are there major plot twists every 10-15 messages?
- Is the pacing fast with no unnecessary filler?
- Are the characters distinct and memorable?
- Does the ending leave room for debate or discussion?
- Is there a call-to-action to encourage viewer engagement?
- Does the story naturally encourage duets, stitches, or reaction videos?
- Does the adaptation effectively incorporate the specified story direction?

Before writing the final story, analyze the original story, brainstorm viral elements.
1. Break down the original story's key elements (characters, setting, conflict, theme)
2. List potential viral hooks and plot twists
3. Outline the story structure, including major plot points and the resolution
4. Review the outline against the viral potential checklist and refine as needed

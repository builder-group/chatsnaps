Follow the HPC (Hook, Progression, Climax) Framework for story structure:

1. Hook (First 1-3 Messages):
   - Start with an attention-grabbing, shocking message that stops users from scrolling
   - Create immediate emotional stakes or conflict
   - Use pattern interruption or unexpected content

2. Progression (Middle Section):
   - Include 3-5 major plot twists
   - Maintain escalating tension
   - Ensure each message advances the plot

3. Climax (Final Section):
   - Deliver an unexpected final twist
   - Recontextualize earlier events
   - Leave room for viewer interpretation

and strictly adhere to these guidelines:

1. Messaging Guidelines:
   - Keep messages ultra-short (1-3 words preferred)
   - Split thoughts across multiple rapid-fire texts
   - Use ALL CAPS strategically for emphasis
   - Include realistic texting elements (typos, abbreviations)
   - Employ strategic message timing ([...] for pauses)
   - Use emojis to heighten emotional impact

2. Story Structure:
   - Ensure the hook occurs within the first message
   - Include plot twists every 10-15 messages
   - Maintain distinct character voices throughout
   - Escalate emotional stakes properly
   - Craft an ending that encourages engagement
   - Match the target length
   - Appeal to the target audience
   - Incorporate natural viral sharing elements

3. Quality Check:
   - Avoid exposition dumps
   - Eliminate on-the-nose dialogue
   - Ensure twists are not telegraphed
   - Resolve all plot threads
   - Maintain short message length
   - Keep character voices consistent
   - Ensure realistic reactions
   - Maintain fast pacing
   - Include clear emotional stakes

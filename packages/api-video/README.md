## ❓ FAQ

### Why "Blueprint" Instead of "Template" or "Generator"?

We chose **"Blueprint"** because it represents a flexible, evolving foundation that users can modify through each stage of the process (e.g. for ChatStory: Prompt → Editing Story → Editing Timeline → Final Video). Unlike **"Template,"** which implies something static, or **"Generator,"** which suggests an instant final output, **"Blueprint"** conveys a customizable plan that evolves, fitting our multi-step flow better.

# Melodic Marble Run

A physics-based 3D marble track generator that creates musical experiences from MIDI sequences.

## Core Concepts

### Physics-Based Generation

The system uses physics simulation to generate a playable marble track where:

- Each plank corresponds to a musical note from the MIDI sequence
- The marble's impact with each plank triggers the corresponding note
- The track follows a general guide path while maintaining playability
- All movement is purely physics-based without artificial forces

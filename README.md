# Shortify  

An experiment in automating short-form content creation.  

> **Archived:** Despite producing higher-quality results than most similar tools, I decided to discontinue Shortify, as I didn't want to contribute to the spread of low-value, brainrot content.  

## Overview  

Shortify was designed to streamline the creation of short-form videos across the following niches:  

- **Chat Stories**  
- **Marble Races**  
- **Marble Melodies**  

While not 100% automated, Shortify drastically cut production time. For example, a polished, high-quality chat story video could be created in 10â€“20 minutes with minor manual tweaks (e.g. improved hooks, images), or fully automated for slightly lower quality due to current AI storytelling limits.

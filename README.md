# Shortify

A experiment in automated short-form content generation.

> **Archived:** While achieving somewhat high-quality output compared to similar tools, the project was discontinued because I realized I didn't want to contribute to the brainrot content proliferation.

## Overview

Shortify was an automation tool that could generate short-form videos for multiple niches:

- Chat Stories/Message Niche
- Marble Races
- Marble Melodies

While not fully automated due to technical limitations, Shortify significantly reduced production time. For example, a high-quality message-based story video could be produced in 10-20 minutes with small manual refinements (like improved hooks, images), or fully automated with slightly lower quality due to current AI constraints (e.g. in storytelling).
